# Latent_liability_model_BEAST
Example XML code for running the multivariate phylogenetic latent liability model in BEAST v1.8.0

This repository contains example XML code for running the multivariate phylogenetic latent liability model (Cybis et al. 2015) in BEAST v1.8.0 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007). This model is a Bayesian phylogenetic comparative method that calculates pariwise correlations between traits and that is capable of handling both continuous and discrete data types.
